# Strategies Backtesting
## Introduction:
In this repository, I will be sharing some trading strategies that I have found on the internet. I will use the "backtrader" library to conduct backtests in order to verify if the results theoretically match those presented by others.

## Objectives:
The primary purpose of this content is educational â€“ to deepen our understanding of the "backtrader" library and the markets.

## Disclaimer:
This is not financial advice. (Please conduct your own backtests.) I am not a professional. While I aspire to become one in the future, I am currently not, and I welcome any suggestions.

I do not intend to discredit anyone or any websites. If you are the owner of something I have posted and you are unhappy with it, please feel free to contact me.
